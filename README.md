# Sum Of A Gun
## Retro First Person Shooter prototype
Prototype FPS Game Level made with C# in Unity, it is made in a retro 3D style with an aesthetic similar to Doom. 
    This is a GreyBoxed Level design built to test out a State Machine to Control Enemy AI behaviour 
    between idle, patrol, chase and attack. Two enemy variants have been created - Shooting and Melee Types, 
    and a weapon System to define weapon class types and ammo. There is also a key-card System to unlock various doors between Areas. 
This Project started out as an FPS Tutorial written by Thomas Devenish, and the I have adapted and built upon this code base to create the game
